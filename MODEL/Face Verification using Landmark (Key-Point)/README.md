# Face Verification Using Landmarks 🌟

🚀 **Welcome to the Face Verification Using Landmarks project!** This repository offers a streamlined Python implementation for verifying faces based on **facial landmarks (keypoints)**. From detection to alignment and verification, everything is covered in an easy-to-understand workflow.

---

## ✨ Features  

1. **👤 Face Detection**  
   Efficiently detects faces using the Haar Cascade classifier.  

2. **📏 Face Alignment**  
   Aligns detected faces using a custom alignment model to ensure consistent positioning.  

3. **🔍 Face Verification**  
   Verifies faces by comparing normalized distances between facial landmarks.  

---

## 🛠️ Workflow  

The process involves the following key steps:  

1. **📥 Input Images**: Accepts two face images as input.  
2. **📸 Face Detection**: Identifies faces in each image using Haar Cascade.  
3. **📌 Landmark Extraction**: Extracts key facial landmarks from detected faces.  
4. **🧭 Face Alignment**: Aligns faces for uniformity using landmark-based transformations.  
5. **⚖️ Landmark Normalization**: Scales and normalizes landmarks to ensure comparability.  
6. **📐 Distance Calculation**: Computes the Euclidean distance between normalized landmarks.  
7. **✅ Decision**: Declares a "Match" or "No Match" based on a predefined distance threshold.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-verification-landmarks.git
cd face-verification-landmarks
```

### 2️⃣ Place Your Images  
Add the two images you want to verify in the `images/` directory.  

### 3️⃣ Run the Script  

1. Update the image paths in `main.py`.  
2. Execute the script:  

```bash
python main.py
```  

### 📊 Output  

- **Aligned Faces**: Visualized for verification.  
- **Extracted Landmarks**: Displayed or saved for inspection.  
- **Distance Score**: Quantitative score between the two images.  
- **Verification Result**: Outputs either **"Match"** ✅ or **"No Match"** ❌.

## ⚙️ Underlying Methods  

### 1️⃣ Face Detection 👁️  
- Utilizes **Haar Cascade Classifier** to detect faces in grayscale images.  

### 2️⃣ Face Alignment 🔄  
- Aligns faces based on eye positions and key landmarks, improving pose consistency.  

### 3️⃣ Distance Calculation 🔢  
- Computes **Euclidean Distance** between normalized facial landmarks for verification.  
- The threshold for declaring a match can be fine-tuned for better accuracy.
