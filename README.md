### Features  

#### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Face Verification Using Landmarks üåü  
A robust face verification system designed to ensure safety and user identity in the Serabutin app.  

**Key Highlights**:  
- **Face Detection**: Detects faces using Haar Cascade classifiers.  
- **Face Alignment**: Aligns detected faces for consistency using landmarks.  
- **Verification**: Compares normalized facial landmarks using Euclidean distance to determine matches.  

**Workflow**:  
1. Detect faces in two images.  
2. Align faces based on landmarks.  
3. Normalize and compare landmarks.  
4. Decide match/no match based on distance threshold.

#### ü§ñ Illegal Job Post Filtering Using NLP  
An NLP-based system to automatically detect and filter illegal or inappropriate job postings, ensuring platform compliance with ethical and legal standards.  

**Key Highlights**:  
- Utilizes a **Bidirectional LSTM model** for text classification.  
- Flags prohibited content with high accuracy to maintain platform integrity.  

**Workflow**:  
1. Preprocess job descriptions into embeddings.  
2. Use bidirectional LSTM layers for contextual feature extraction.  
3. Apply dense layers for binary classification (Legal/Illegal).
