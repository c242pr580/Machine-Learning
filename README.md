### Features  

#### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Face Verification Using Landmarks üåü  
A robust face verification system designed to ensure safety and user identity in the Serabutin app.  

**Key Highlights**:  
- **Face Detection**: Detects faces using Haar Cascade classifiers.  
- **Face Alignment**: Aligns detected faces for consistency using landmarks.  
- **Verification**: Compares normalized facial landmarks using Euclidean distance to determine matches.  

**Workflow**:  
1. Detect faces in two images.  
2. Align faces based on landmarks.  
3. Normalize and compare landmarks.  
4. Decide match/no match based on distance threshold.  

**Future Enhancements**:  
- Transition to advanced face detection (e.g., MTCNN).  
- Integrate deep learning for precise verification.

#### ü§ñ Illegal Job Post Filtering Using NLP  
An NLP-based system to automatically detect and filter illegal or inappropriate job postings, ensuring platform compliance with ethical and legal standards.  

**Key Highlights**:  
- Utilizes a **Bidirectional LSTM model** for text classification.  
- Flags prohibited content with high accuracy to maintain platform integrity.  

**Workflow**:  
1. Preprocess job descriptions into embeddings.  
2. Use bidirectional LSTM layers for contextual feature extraction.  
3. Apply dense layers for binary classification (Legal/Illegal).  

**Future Enhancements**:  
- Dynamic model updates for evolving legal requirements.  
- Expand dataset diversity to improve robustness.

### Requirements  
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **ML Libraries**: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- **CV Libraries**: OpenCV  

**Install**:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
